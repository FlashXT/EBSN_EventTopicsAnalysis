12542," • What we'll do Which One Describes the Person? When you say “I”, where is it exactly in the chart? What are the factors that create the sense of individuality? When people say ""I am a Scorpio, or I am Gemini, etc."" they are usually referring to their Sun-sign, completely unaware of the Rising Sign and its Ruler. To make matters worse, modern astrology books indiscriminately blur the lines between the ASC-sign, the Moon-sign and the Sun-sign - all description sounding alike. This lecture clarifies the confusion, making a clear distinction between these three. It also explores the role of the dispositor and how it affects the Ruler of the Ascendant. We will identify “the power grid” in the chart and the components on which it is built.

12542," Astrologers ruminate on lunar phases, yet little attention is given to the other planets which experience shifts in phase. In this talk, we will explore the process of planetary phase and its implications in chart interpretation.   Together, we will assess how to interpret a planet coming to a conjunction of the Sun: what does it mean for a planet to draw near to the Sun, enter into its heart (the moment classically termed ‘cazimi’), and emerge again as a renewed planetary energy in the east at dawn, or the west at sunset?   We will explore the changes to planetary nature encountered at the sextiles of the Sun, the squares, the trines and opposition. Just as each planet’s speed is adapted by its configuration with the Sun, a fluent chart interpretation requires some exposure to how this is experienced visually and symbolically in the sky around us.   This presentation will give you solid foundational knowledge of planetary cycles and phase: what the Sun’s chief operations are astronomically and astrologically, how this impacts a planet’s behavior, how to spot a planet’s phase visually, what factors you’ll want to bring in as you interpret a planet’s living dance within a chart, etc., bringing it all together at the close with modern case studies. You will receive handout material to help you study further. This presentation is suitable for all levels of astrologers.

12542,"  TOPIC    Mercury going retrograde is one of astrology’s most popular—but also most notorious and misunderstood—phenomena. It's tempting to tell ourselves ""Mercury is retrograde. I will hide under my bed until it goes direct. But... will my bed collapse on me?""    The truth is Mercury is retrograde about 20% of the year, but if we include concepts like ""pre-shadow"", ""shadow"" and ""post shadow"", we are theoretically experiencing some level of Mercury Rx almost half the year. Isn’t that a lot of time to hold off?    Let’s explore how Mercury Rx periods are about more than things going wrong or not as planned. They are also potent periods for discovery and retrospection. The parade of re keywords—like REvising, REthinking, REviewing, REvising—gives us a glimpse into the alchemy of this period.    Each retrograde period differs depending upon the activated sign and other planetary configurations. This time around Mercury’s backward invitation through Sagittarius has a special link with the Saturn cycle and its momentous ingression into Capricorn later on this month. How can we understand this Mercury Rx as the final act of Saturn in Sagittarius, and preparation for Saturn in Capricorn?    We are gathering a few astrologers to talk about Mercury Rx: what it is, and what it isn't, how to discern how it affects you personally, and what to do about it.    Hint: Your bed will not collapse over you, but hiding under it is generally a bad idea.

Saturn's job: to make real the changes Pluto began in 2008. While Uranus in Taurus will initiate us into innovating a new way to value our individual contributions to society.
