Join us in examining the astrology of the new dwarf planet Eris - named
after the Greek goddess of strife and chaos, who gave Paris the golden
apple over which Aphrodite, Hera and Athena quarreled.

Eris’s discovery in 2005 led to Pluto’s infamous demotion one year later.
For all its power to disrupt, Eris often remains in obscurity. Several
prominent astrologers currently leave Eris out of their horoscopes.

In this presentation, J Valentine Lahey will introduce us to working with
Eris: an overview of its discovery and controversies, the mythology
attached to its naming process, as well as possible astrological affinities
and influence.

Does Eris work in astrology? How might Eris manifest in the study of a
personal chart? Is Eris affecting the world astrologically?

Major breakthroughs in astronomy have typically seen a corresponding
shift in culture and as humanity’s view of the universe changes. The
process happens on the deeper, archetypal levels of awareness where
astrology thrives. How might we understand recent cultural shifts as the
emergence of Eris?

Eris speaks in riddles and jokes, complex puzzles that reward an
enlightened spirit of play. Expect disagreement, and don’t take any of it too seriously… because she doesn’t.
